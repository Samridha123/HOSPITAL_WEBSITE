      <h4 id="simple-list-item-1">OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>ANANTHAPURI HOSPITALS AND RESEARCH INSTITUTE (AHRI) at Kazhakuttam – Kovalam By Pass road, about 3km from Thiruvananthapuram Railway Station / Thampanoor Bus Stand, 2km from Thiruvananthapuram Airport, is a 400 bedded Tertiary care Hospital with an investment of 100 crores. The first phase of the Hospital with all major Departments, has become functional from 1st July 2005.</p>

      <p>This hospital block was formally inaugurated by our Honorable Chief Minister Sri. Oommen Chandy on 14th September 2005 in the presence of Dr. M. K. Munneer, Minister for PWD (Public Works Department), Sri. M. V. Raghavan, Minister for Ports and other distinguished guests.</p>

      <p>Ananthapuri Hospitals & Research Institute has some of the most eminent doctors in the country –highly experienced, skilled and distinguished in their respective fields of expertise. Your healthcare needs are safe in their hands. Complementing them and paving the way for the smooth functioning of the hospital is a team of highly dedicated personnel manning the various departments, thus fulfilling the hospital’s mission of providing service with sincerity and solicitude.</p>

      <p>Advancing demand for quality health care combined with the capacity and willingness of patients to pay more for top-flight services creates a congenial atmosphere for private sector participation in the health care sector. People's participation and patronage make healthcare today the world’s largest industry. Yet to meet the new millennium health care challenges effectively, we do have to go a long way. We have to shoulder our own share of the responsibility in meeting this challenge successfully in order to create a better India where people can lead a healthier life in the new millennium.</p>

<p>AHRI, the first tertiary hospital project of Ananthapuri Hospitals Private Limited, is conceived and being implemented with the above end in view. Founded and promoted by a team of Medical Professionals who are all rated quite eminent in their respective disciplines, AHRI aims to play a predominant role in the development of healthcare services in India by setting new trends and bringing about changes cherished and earnestly sought by the society. With the kind of features we already have and are to have by its inception we are confident of achieving this avowed goal.</p>
      <h4 id="simple-list-item-2">CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE</h4>
      <p>Padma Shree Dr. A. Marthanda Pillai.
Chairman</p>
      <P>For Ananthapuri Hospitals & Research Institute (AHRI).</P>
      <P>Thank you very much for giving me this online opportunity to speak to you, making use of your most valuable time. I earnestly hope that this would mark the beginning of a meaningful association between you and 'Ananthapuri'.</P>

<p>It was more than a decade ago that 'Ananthapuri' got conceived in the mind of its primary promoters (me included) as a modest Venture consisting of only a couple of specialties like Neurology and Gynecology. As time passed, the advisability of embarking upon such a center, which invariably confines its scope of service only to a very small segment of the Society, dwindled against the extreme need and urgency of establishing tertiary level hospitals capable of catering to the healthcare needs of all sections of the Society at affordable rates. Detailed studies on the feasibility and viability of such a Project having its location in Thiruvananthapuram ensued. Positive results prompting planned action to implement the scheme emerged. Leading doctors, held in high esteem, who could presumably subscribe and contribute to the view, were taken into confidence and consulted. Marathon meetings involving more and more experts representing various branches of medicine, who could share and further strengthen the view, took place. Ananthapuri', as a 400 bedded tertiary hospital, became a reality as all resolved to join hands to implement the Project in two phases, the first consisting of Cardiology and Neurology (along with basic specialties) in May, 2005 and the final phase including all the specialties by 2006.</P>
